# Non-Functional Requirements

Here is the list of some of the non functional requirements that I can think of: 

**Usability:**
- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with feedback loop as needed. 
- Localization should be implemented. 

**Compatibility:**
- Application should be iOS compatible for now. If time allows, it should be optimized for Android and then web as well. 
- If optimized for all platforms, the consistent behavior and UI clues should be maintained. 
- Optimization should be done with the use of native API's as much as possible. 

**Performance:** 
- The app should be able to handle a large number of tasks efficiently without significant performance degradation. 

**Scalability:**
- The system should be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of users and tasks without compromising performance. 

**Security:**
- Critical user information should be encrypted. 
- The app should be protected against security risks such as SQL injection.

**Code maintainability:**
- The codebase should be well-structured, modular, and thoroughly documented. 

**Privacy:**
- User data should be handled securely and if possible, encrypted.
